Animal Cop
Overview (what, who, why, how)

Team Animal Cop included (names). I acted as the product manager throughout this project, keeping our group rolling over the course of the semester long assignment, as well as playing a key role in building out the front-end development of the final interactive prototype.

Reflections
Team Animal Cop worked hard to create a fully-functional MVP to deliver to our non-profit clients, because we wanted to create something that they could make use of as soon as possible. Additionally, we created documentation of both our process and technical documentation of the MVP in order to empower others to innovate upon what we began, which is available publically. While the solution is designed specifically for the Humane Society, we encourage others to consider adopting it, as an open source solution for other shelters and communities to utilize. 
EatSleepPoop
Overview (what, who, why, how)
Eat Sleep Poop Appÿhelps parents log important information about their newborn babies, created a few years ago by recent parent, and UX researcher, Sergi Bosch. I?ve been working with the team since July to evaluate and redesign the UX and UI based on user insights, testing and analytics, and eventually designing for wearables. 
Initial Research
Before digging into the design, I needed to gain a deeper understanding of my users- parents of newborn babies up to 5 months old.  Luckily, there were a number of new parents at work, allowing me to conduct quick user interviews and user testing sessions to inform my own thinking.  Additionally, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of each interaction within the app, creating a map of user interactions and goals throughout the app.
